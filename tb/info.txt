tb/ (Testbench)
This is not hardware. It’s a simulation driver that:
generates a clock
applies reset
drives inputs (like start/op_code/memory responses)
checks outputs
Think: TB = the script that plays the role of “CPU + RAM + environment” around your design


tb/tb_gpu_top.sv
This is your current testbench. It does only three things:
makes a clock
toggles reset
waits a bit and prints “SMOKE TEST DONE”
It is not testing correctness yet. It’s just verifying:
Verilator can compile everything
the simulation runs
Why this matters: early in hardware projects you want to know “my build flow works” before you spend hours writing logic.
